# 4.OAKLAND: A CASE STUDYStartup Policy Lab (SPL) is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California, that helps policymakers navi- gate issues relating to new technologies and fosters data- driven decisionmaking at the policy level. In November of 2014, SPL and the City Attorney of Oakland, organized a roundtable discussion about government data and privacy with the goal of providing an opportunity for the worlds of academia, technology, and government to learn from each other and begin to address the challenges behind any such program [12].One of the most important ideas to come out of the roundtablewas what we termed “non-consensual transparency.” This occurs when the government seeks to share information— perhaps through an open data program—either about, or derived from, information it acquires about its citizens in its role as government. Government is pervasive, and, in many cases, they acquire a wide variety of personal data, from criminal records to financial and health information. Moreover, unlike private companies, governments often have the ability to compel the collection of personal information, and there is no opt-out mechanism for governments. The city of Oakland recognized that it needed to be especially careful with this information, as the sheer scale of it raised all manner of privacy and security questions.It quickly became clear that the government also faced potential liability issues, as it was suddenly operating as something analogous to a data broker with its citizens’ in- formation. And with liability comes a host of compliance requirements, systematic data protection procedures, bu- reaucratic protocols, and possibly new legal mechanisms to externalize that liability to the third parties that employed that data. For example, traditional Freedom of Informa- tion frameworks present in all major municipalities and the federal government are rarely written with the subtlety re- quired to navigate the inferences that might be made from data. And on an economic level, it is equally clear that while governments can reap the benefits of large-scale data collection and analysis, the risks are almost entirely exter- nalized onto the citizen themselves. In the event of a data breach, while the government will bear some of the cost, most of the harm will befall individual citizens whose data was stolen. Or if some of the city’s economic models inad- vertently use unfair algorithms, it is the least fortunate and powerful among us who may be most affected.On a more philosophical level, the roundtable members came to a consensus that the role of government is chang- ing, due in large part to the increased amount of data it is collecting and the myriad uses to which it can put that data. In addition to all of its other jobs, governments now serve as data stewards for their citizens, and doing that job well requires a delicate interplay among the underlying technol- ogy, the policymakers, and the citizens themselves. It seems highly unlikely that municipalities are going to collect less data in the future, but it also seems just as likely that we will uncover many beneficial uses to which we can put this data in the future. It is vital to recognize that the great potential of the open data movement needs to be balanced against the political, technical, social, and legal forces in play.The final lesson of this case study is a practical one. While Oakland was enthusiastic about addressing these issues, it lacked the bureaucratic, political, and financial tools neces- sary to implement the roundtable’s recommendations. The machinery of politics moves slowly and inconsistently, and the success or failure of endeavors like this one can turn upon forces far beyond the control of those involved. The content of the roundtable discussion demonstrated the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to integrating the tools of data science into existing civic infrastructure. The difficulties in translating the roundtables’ recommendations into practice teaches us that we need far more collaborative engagement among NGOs, academia, and governments, to ensure that at least some of the ideas survive all of the competing forces at play.
