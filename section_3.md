# 3. THE PERILS OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESData science is a powerful tool. And like any tool, it can be put to many uses, both for good and for ill. And no matter how pure one’s intentions, even the very act of col- lecting data can have potentially serious repercussions, as has been demonstrated by the endless stream of high-profile data breaches that has become as much a part of modern life as ship-wrecking storms were a few centuries ago. The trouble comes from the fact that the grim work of forecast- ing the possible dangers that might arise from a data set [18, p. 1748] is rarely integrated into the development process for most data science projects. This section describes two such examples—first, the practical difficulties of genuinely anonymizing data in order to protect the privacy of the dataset’s subjects, and second, some of the incidental harms that the practice of widespread data analytics can inflict upon individuals, sometimes without the knowledge of the data scientists themselves.
