#5.2 Neutrality of Analytical Methods1. What analytical techniques are to be used? Is it pos- sible to communicate the basics of these techniques to partners in the project? Are there other resources available to help the non-technical members of a col- laboration learn more about how the technical side works?2. Are they well-understood solutions to the types of prob- lems posed in this particular project?3. In choosing which algorithms to use, what other factors influenced the development of the algorithms in the first place? How could these competing factors (if any) skew the results of the analysis?4. Are these methods open-sourced, and have they been vetted by experts with specific subject matter exper- tise in the initial problem space? Is there an existing ecosystem of information exchange that the parties can rely upon? If not, what would it take to create one to make similar projects more efficient in the future?
