Doing Good The Right Way: Hard Questions To Ask of Any Data Science Project, and How To Get the Answers
=======

Data science, especially when we attempt to apply it to complex societal problems, is as much an art as it is a science. And thanks to our ever-increasing capacity to collect and process information, we are able ask questions that would have been intractable a decade ago. Even with these advances, it is vital to remember that, except in the simplest of cases, we must construct models of the systems that we wish to analyze from the data that is available. In the case of the vast majority of social problems, there is rarely enough data available to create high-definition models. The choices that we make at this early modeling phase can spell the eventual success or failure of a given endeavor.
