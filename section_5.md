# 5. THE BIG QUESTIONSThe first two sections of this paper focused upon the chal- lenges inherent in addressing social issues through data sci- ence and machine learning, while the third presented an ex- ample of how these considerations could be translated, by way of a nonprofit organization, into a format to which a city government was receptive. Here, we attempt to extract the lessons learned from this process into a more general form. This list is not intended to be a step-by-step guide to- wards scoping a data science project; instead, it is intended to clearly define issues that are often overlooked throughout the development process, as their impact can be hidden until after the project is completed. Addressing these questions is a vital task for all parties involved in a data science project, as the familiarity of data scientists with the more technical aspects of the questions can supplement and be informed by the legal, social, and political factors they raise in the minds of NGOs, governments, and other, less technical actors.The questions below could be answered in a variety of media, from collaborative roundtables as described in the previous section, to online resources created by NGOs, to academic symposia organized by universities, to industry conferences set up by corporate stakeholders or foundations. Regardless of the particular form of the answers, the impor- tant thing is to gather insight from as many different per- spectives as possible, in a context where those insights can play off one another to raise the overall level of understand- ing.
