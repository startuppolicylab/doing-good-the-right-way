# 5.1 Sufficiency of the Data1. What specific questions is this data science project at- tempting to solve? How will the answers to those ques- tions translate into practical, tangible results?2. Is this the type of problem that can be solved through well-understood applications of data analysis or ma- chine learning? Do all the parties involved understand how the technology is being applied and how much they can trust the answers they receive?3. In a perfect world, what data are required to answer these questions properly?4. Are these data available? If not, whatâ€™s missing? What can other groups do to provide this missing informa- tion? What types of approximations are available to make up for this lack?5. In the case of approximations, are they reasonable in the context of the initial questions? What uncertain- ties do they introduce?6. Is the data in a form that is susceptible to processing and analysis? If not, how much work would it take to transform the data into a useful format? Who would do that work, and how much would it cost? Are the resources available?
