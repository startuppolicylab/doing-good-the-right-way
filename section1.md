# 1. INTRODUCTION

Data science, especially when we attempt to apply it to complex societal problems, is as much an art as it is a sci- ence. This is almost tautological: social problems are not math problems, and they rarely fit neatly into the cells of a spreadsheet or arrange themselves along an easily-defined curve. Thanks to our ever-increasing capacity to collect and process information, we are able ask questions that would have been intractable a decade ago. Even with these advances, it is vital to remember that, except in the simplest of cases, we must construct models of the systems that we wish to analyze from the data that is available. In the case of the vast majority of social problems, there is rarely enough data available to create high-definition models; instead, we are forced to make approximations to fill in the gaps. The choices that we make at this early modeling phase can spell the eventual success or failure of a given endeavor. They can also create significant second-order effects that echo far be- yond the scope of that project, sometimes to the detriment of the very people we are trying to help. Fully understand- ing the dynamics of these aftershocks often requires input from a variety of perspectives, such as those that could be provided by nonprofits, academics, subject matter experts, and others.

This paper highlights some of these decision points that can arise during this initial phase. It then shows that one of the best ways to approach them is not as strict prob- lems of data science, but as a complex set of interconnected choices that draws from a variety of disciplines. Although this paper focuses upon the challenges and difficulties inher- ent in applying data science for social good, our goal is not to denigrate the endeavor as a whole. Instead, we seek to shed light upon some areas that tend to be under-discussed in the current conversation, and also to give some examples of how governments and nonprofit organizations can work together to address some of these problems.

In Section 2, we argue that the statistical methods that form the heart of data science and machine learning require that we ask questions about the validity of any data set that we might wish to analyze. While the questions stem from the underlying mathematics, answering them requires a far broader set of skills. Unfortunately, at the moment there are relatively few sources of this type of interdisciplinary ex- pertise beyond a few well-meaning, if under-resourced, non- governmental organizations. We highlight several examples of how data that seems useful on its face often misses crucial information.

Section 3 discusses some of the challenges that occur any time a large enough body of data is collected in one place. While we focus primarily upon the problems of reidentifi- cation and the potential unfairness of algorithms, it should be understood that this is only a small part of the overall set of difficulties in determining how a body of data may be (mis)used in the future.

Section 4 provides a brief case study of a collaboration be- tween Startup Policy Lab (SPL), a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, and the City Attorney of Oakland. The NGO and the local government officials together con- vened an interdisciplinary roundtable of academics, attor- neys, technologists, and policymakers to discuss a variety of issues on the subjects of government open data and privacy, touching on many of the topics discussed in this paper.

Section 5 proposes a series of general questions that can be asked of almost any data science project that attempts to address a fuzzy-edged, complex issue. These questions, built in part upon the experiences of SPL, are designed to provide guidance throughout the early decision and modeling phases of a data science project. If addressed directly, they should both maximize the probability of project success while si- multaneously minimizing the number of negative secondary effects that might follow. They also demonstrate the role a relatively small organization can play in connecting various stakeholders together and aligning their efforts.
